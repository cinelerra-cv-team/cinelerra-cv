  calling base methods only.
Time average finally implemented. Deinterlace implemented.
Translation in screencapture recording implemented.
AVI parameter editing box.
Drag and drop of assets during an index build doesn't lock up.
Dragging mixtures of audio and video works better.  Better handling of
  shared effects which are off.
Batches can be moved up and down the list.


	12/6/01
OpenDIVX debugging:
Fixed bugs in decore2: *run = *last = -1; was not copied over from encore50.
Rewrote bitstream parser in encore2 and decore2 to be more reliable.
Disabled MMX due to crashes in Redhat 7.2.
Discovered decore2 can't do P frames so switched back to decore50.
Renamed header files, symbols to all
  in the same program.
Renamed more symbols in mpeg2enc to coexist with opendivx.
To make encore2 work on 64 bit processors:
  Typecasted offsets in CompensateBlock and get_ref to (int)

Decore50 still not functional on 64 bit processors.
Implemeneted PNG list output.  Debugged list output and input.
Configuration dialog for OpenDivx in Cinelerra migrated from encore50
  to encore2.
Configuration dialog for Vorbis and Vorbis export to Quicktime.
Can use shift-R to render.
DV encoding implemented.  The last libdv library only supported MMX and B&W.


	12/16/01
Moved all OpenDivx support to the encore50 derivative of the encoder.
  This appears to do everything that the encore2 derivative could do at
  equal or lesser reliability.
Changed bmp argument for decore50 to 3 member array.  Added quant
  argument which, when set to nonzero, fixes the quantization.  OpenDivx
  with fixed quantization looks 33% better than MPEG-2.
Direct copy rendering for OpenDivx so output of the renderfarm can be
  direct copied into a single file.

Moved all theme support into a plugin.  Resources are no longer
  compiled in but concatenated to the binaries.  This made compilation
  take less time and should theoretically allow more themes to be
  supported without increasing resident set size.
Made ports specific to each render node instead of global.  This way
  multiple Cinelerra clients can run on the same box without violating
  the single thread requirement of new libraries.
Cinelerra daemon forks to background.  Made assets export more
  compression parameters to render nodes.
Vorbis decoding in Quicktime without seeking.  The encoding is probably
  not going to change anymore but Vorbis doesn't appear seekable.  No-one
  is going to use OpenDivx and Vorbis without an endorsement from
  Microsoft anyway.


	12/22/01
Seeking support for Quicktime/Vorbis.  Support for Vorbis on 64 bit
  processors.  Further debugging of Divx.  Quality of 6 yields errors in
  output.  Quality of 5 seems to be the maximum.  Changed fourcc from
  VBIS to OggS for vorbis.
To make Vorbis work on 64 bit processors:
  change sizeof(int) to sizeof(int*) in lib/floor1.c: 263
Menu effects can paste into the timeline.
Changes in label handling when pasting resources.
Statusbar and zoombar resizing restored.
Implemented code to move plugin sets up and down a level.

Improved table of contents support for libmpeg3.  This scans every byte
  of the mpeg files and records the location of every keyframe and every
  sample of audio.  The table of contents can then be loaded by
  Cinelerra, allowing frame accurate editing from mpeg source material.
A memory allocation bug in the Linux kernel crashes the system when
  using mpeg3toc on DVD's so forget about transcoding Starwars on a
  render farm.  Don't know who discovered that either.


	12/28/01
Ignored the warnings and set -ieee for all files in quicktime to fix
  floating point exceptions.  This made it twice as slow but it worked.
Floating point exceptions in the following places were fixable with
  certain changes:

vorbis_lpc_predict    ->  A return statement before anything is done.
bark_noise_pointmp    ->  noise[i] could be set to 0
bark_noise_hybridmp   ->  noise[i] could be set to 0

Defining VORBIS_IEEE_FLOAT32 seemed to fix mapping0 crashes so the
  preceeding changes were backed out.
Loading XML files with multiple video tracks works better.
Linux 2.4.17 handles DVD table of contents operations better but
  crashes after 5 hours of reading a DVD.  You'll have to reboot often to
  control memory corruption.


	1/4/02

Enabled deletion of assets and clips from the project.  Also can delete
  assets from disk.
Rebuild indices should handle multiple indices if selected.

  in fixed bitrate modes above 7000000 is recommended for DV footage for now.
Assets and effects are now sortable in the Resource window.  Text
  displays aren't corrupted as much.

VWindow it performs frame advance.
Mix2000 update for mouse wheel.


	5/17/02
Pulling the official MICROSOFT mouse wheel back zooms out the CWindow
  when using the zoom tool.

Brought back the last reflection level in Heroine College Concert Hall
  since backwards reverb seems to be popular.
Paste automation resampling implemented.
Splice and overwrite debugged.  Paste_edls doesn't change the VWindow

Plugin titles updated when track titles change.
Create clip with just in or out point creates something of positive length.
Create clip with no in or out point takes the entire length in VWindow.
Labels enabled in VWindow.

Video tracks are added to the top of the stack while audio tracks are added
  to the bottom of the stack.
Dragging an effect from one track to a zero length track retains the length
  of the effect instead of crashing.
Dragging an effect from the Resource Window onto a zero length track doesn't
  insert the effect on the track.


	6/14/02
Bilinear interpolation from Broadcast 2000 migrated over.  This
  averaged more pixels than the standard bilinear interpolation we
  upgraded to in 2000.

Mutual exclusion lock for liba52 since liba52 can't run two frame
  decodes simultaneously.
Removed double lock from Heroine College Concert Hall.
Correctly detects playable tracks more often.
Bezier curves for fade and zoom.
64 bit mpeg file support.  XMovie plays 64 bit mpeg files.

Variable channel numbers work finally.  Audio pans adjust when channel
  count changes.
DV encoding in color works slightly better but still corrupted on the
  right side.  The libdv upgrade can't decode of course.

After assessing levels of interest, marketing direction, and
  experiencing a CVS erasing filesystem crash we moved forward on the
  folding of all code into a single repository.  Moved quicktime,
  libmpeg3, xmovie, mix2000, and 2 mpeg multiplexing tools into the
  cinelerra tree and renamed the one gigantic tree hvirtual.  The upside
  is Cinelerra compilation only requires exporting CFLAGS instead of
  hunting down 5 packages and exporting CFLAGS.  The downside is the one
  guy who uses Quicktime has to download a bigger package through his
  bankrupt ISP's refurbished 1998 reissued cable modem.
Mind you everything except cinelerra and plugins will remain
  independant of each other.
While it may work for servers ext3 isn't suitable for desktops which
  are constantly shut down and restarted.


	6/21/02

  length.  This allows keyframe undo for regions where no edits exist.

Update undo routines can be called recursively without corrupting the undo table.
Undoing and redoing keyframe adjustments works better.
Bilinear reduction with alpha channels fixed.
Memory leak removed from Quicktime udta.

Copy added to CWindow buttons.  Cut removed from VWindow buttons.
Copying always takes session parameters, so it works in VWindow instead
  of crashing.

Audio module fragment reduced to support Linux 2.4.18.  Maximum DMA
  allocation is no longer supported in 2.4.18 so audio fragments must be kept below 4096.

Units in freeverb changed to DB.


	7/19/02

A lot of patches were rejected.  Some were accepted.  Most of these
  coding practices were done in 1997 but abandonned later because of high
  maintenance.  To save code size, the memory leak checker shouldn't flag
  single allocations as leaks and static pointers shouldn't be explicitely deleted on exit.

titler-charsets.diff

merged.

	cinelerra-loop-patch*
The bugs in loops and audio positioning were fixed another way.

	cursor-patch.diff
Too much maintenance in function indirection with no effect.
Explicit declaration of the movement distance requires too much
maintenance.  The move commands were separated for scalability reasons.

	mempatch-2.diff
Units::topower was already static.  Patch has no effect and requires
too much maintenance.

	mempatch-3.diff:
DefaultTheme is intended to be replaced by a subclass of BC_Theme and
use BC_Theme for all memory management.  No expansion of this file is
maintainable.
ArrayList::aray_delete was merged.
Changes to BC_Meter, BC_Resources require too much maintainence and
have no effect.
Static variables in BC_WindowBase prevent different windows in the same
application from having different fonts.
Deletion of pointers in AWindow, CWindow, VWindow, MWindow requires too
much maintenance.
Buttons in AWindow may be used in the future and should not be deleted.
Buttons in editpanel may be used in the future and should not be deleted.
Selections were replaced by masks.  Deleted from VTrack.

	mempatch-5.diff
BC_NewFolderThread expansion done differently.
BC_FileBox widget deletion already done by BC_WindowBase.  Too much code for no effect.
BC_ProgressBar::~BC_ProgressBar() implemented.
BC_Resources changes have no effect.
It's already a static object and if the images were overridden, their BC_Theme class would delete the lists.
BC_WindowBase changes were preemptively rejected.
Canvas::~Canvas merged.
CPanel::~CPanel already done by BC_WindowBase.  Too much code.
CWindowGUI::~CWindowGUI mostly done by BC_WindowBase.
MeterPanel::~MeterPanel merged
Module::create_new_attachments merged
StatusBar::~StatusBar already done by BC_SubWindow.
theme.C too much code.
VirtualConsole::~VirtualConsole introduced too many bugs.
ZoomBar::~ZoomBar partially merged.  Mostly done by BC_SubWindow.
DefaultTheme::DeleteVFrames is done by BC_Theme.
title.C fonts is a static variable because it shouldn't be deleted.

	mempatch-6.diff
BC_FileBox done differently.  Lock_window is normally used when updating a GUI from a thread.
mempatch-7.diff
VirtualConsole refurbishment was handled differently.
filevorbis.C asymetric fclose patch applied.
mempatch-9.diff
MWindow::load_filenames memory management applied. Rest has no effect.
mempatch-10.diff
decode_lock is static because it shouldn't be deleted. Rest has no effect.

Audio and video playback through firewire.  Can't get a playable
  audio stream for the camcorder in realtime but the interface is there.
Quicktime: Libraw1394 and grabbing removed.  Didn't serve any purpose
  since  playback requires a completely different mechanism than record.
Quicktime, XMovie, Cinelerra: ffmpeg decoder used in MPEG-4.  This
  gives slightly faster playback but is lousy at seeking.
More file writing recovery from crashes.
Cinelerra: Module dereferences renderengine less often in nonrealtime
  effects where renderengine is 0.
Quicktime: Importing of dvgrab and lavtools AVI files.
Cinelerra: Hitting space rapidly doesn't lock up recording as much.
Cinelerra: Resize Render effect window.
Cinelerra: Changing parameters for PCM file works more often.
Cinelerra: tiff upgraded to 3.1.7
Firehose: Fixed bug in firehose reciever.
Cinelerra: Virtual file system for renderfarm.
 - The filesystem prefix for rendering nodes was decidedly useless so it was
   discontinued.
Cinelerra: Time stretch based on overlapping windows instead of FFT.
Cinelerra: Freeze frame has line doubling option.
Integrated mpeg2enc, toolame, lame encoding as libraries.
Toolame refurbishment:
 - converted exit to return in main.
 - put prototypes in filempeg.h
 - created input buffer management.
 - forced stdin at all times
 - created error and eof variables.
 - freq2bark -> toolame_freq2bark
mpeg2enc symbol conflicts:
 - putbits -> mpeg2enc_putbits
 - SmpFrqIndex -> toolame_SmpFrqIndex
 - BitrateIndex -> toolame_BitrateIndex

edit and effect titles stay visible at all times.  We'll see how long this lasts.

long replaced with int64 wherever possible.  After many years of
  assuming long would automatically scale to whatever it was compiled on,
  it appears more of a pain than a scalability point in matters of
  function overloading.
Default configuration should run on stock Redhat 9.0 system.

	Patches:
loop-crush.diff applied
exit-crush.diff too much code for no effect
splash-leak.diff applied
overlay-speedup.diff applied
overlay-speedup2.diff applied
titler-stroke.diff
titler-stroke2.diff applied but disabled due to SMP crash. (crush)
	Added Outline style and tumbler.
	Reduced number of exits due to bounds checking errors.

quicktime_leak.diff applied
small-clean2.diff file may be closed and reopened without calling destructor.

patchbay_free.diff applied but the real problem was PatchBay::update()
	dereferenced non-existent tracks to get the ID.

perspective_alpha_stretch.diff applied
virtualconsole_leak.diff applied but the default destructors seem to be
	getting called.
dvlib_bug_workaround.diff applied
debian_new_dvlib_compile.diff applied

multihead_compositor-1.1.5.diff rejected  The X11 parameter in Playback
preferences is the compositor display.

filexml.diff applied
paste-outpoints.diff needs testing

paste-outpoints.diff rejected.  Broke other paste behavior.  The paste
  behavior is not a uniform case but the result of trying behaviors on a
  case by case basis and deciding which behavior is the most convenient.
  Most of the time what's convenient is not the most scientific.
